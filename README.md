introduction to orbital mechanics with python

1. The Two Body Problem
- Small body of mass less than the larger body it is orbiting 
- Study of the differential equations that are produced when studying these orbits. 
- Newtons laws of motion: Specifically the universal gravitational law
- Keplers Laws of elliptical orbits 

2. Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) solvers
- position, velocity, and acceleration are related by differentiating the position vector once(for velocity) and twice (for acceleration)
- Eulers method for solving ODE's
- Runge-Kutta Method
